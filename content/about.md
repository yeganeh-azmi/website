ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Yeganeh Azmi** â€” a curious and motivated **Junior Digital Marketer** based in Berlin.

I bring a creative yet data-informed approach to digital marketing, with hands-on experience in **social media management**, **SEO**, and **content strategy**. At **Ambrosys**, I helped grow engagement by 40% and successfully launched a brand-new Instagram channel from scratch â€” combining analytics with compelling content to build community.

Outside of work, I created and scaled a **YouTube gaming channel** to over **2,000 subscribers** and **1 million views**, giving me firsthand insight into what makes content click with real people. I also enjoy experimenting with **AI tools** like ChatGPT to enhance content creation, automate workflows, and generate new marketing ideas.

What drives me? The sweet spot between **creativity and data**. Whether itâ€™s building campaigns, analyzing performance, or exploring the next digital trend â€” Iâ€™m always learning, iterating, and evolving.
